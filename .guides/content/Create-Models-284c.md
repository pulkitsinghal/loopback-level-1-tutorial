# Create models

* Kick off the model generator

``` bash
$ cd hello-world
$ slc loopback:model
```

* The generator guides you through creating your model. Enter the values highlighted in blue. To accept the default, just press Enter.

``` bash
? Enter the model name: person                                                      
? Select the data-source to attach person to: db (memory)                           
? Select model's base class: PersistedModel                                         
? Expose person via the REST API? Yes                                               
? Custom plural form (used to build REST URL): people                               
Let's add some person properties now.

```

* Make the property required.
